# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is an IOS application built in SwiftUI with a MVVM design pattern. The application fetches data from the SMHI API using a user input for longitude & altitude and 
updates the weather on the device accordingly.
Other side features such as inaccessibility without network and error handling are also implemented.
